## Analyzing the external review comments of IPBES assessments

Authors: Andrea Pacheco + IPBES Nexus fellows

#### Description:

#### Motivation: 
Over the past decade, IPBES has conducted more than ten assessments, synthesizing knowledge at global and regional scales, across different thematic and methodological topics. A key part of the assessment production is the external review process, as it ensures global reach and transparency. In this process, government representatives, other stakeholders, and external experts across disciplines are invited to review the draft reports and make suggestions for improving the assessment’s quality, robustness, as well as the representation of multiple perspectives. For transparency and traceability of the assessment reports, the review comments from many of these assessments have been made publicly available, including the names, governments, or affiliations of external reviewers, as well as authors' responses to the comments and suggestions. While these comments reflect a variety of disciplines, delegations, socio-economic and political backgrounds, there has been no empirical analysis aimed at understanding how the review process has influenced the assessments to date. Better understanding the impact of the review process - the direction in which comments can steer assessments, as well as the patterns these comments may indicate (e.g., topical, geographical, others), could help improve future IPBES assessments and the review process that underpins the platform’s effective knowledge synthesis. 
#### Research question: 
How does the IPBES review process shape topics, patterns, and perspectives that are portrayed in the final version of IPBES assessment reports?
#### Research idea and proposal: 
We propose an empirical analysis of the review comments of IPBES assessments published to date.
